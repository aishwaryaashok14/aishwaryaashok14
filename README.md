<h1> Hi, I'm Aishwarya 👋 </h1>

I build AI-first products and ship them: from zero-to-one platforms to agent-powered tools that solve real problems.

9+ years in SaaS, now fully focused on AI agents, orchestration, and turning models into products people actually use. I've been a founding PM, a product marketer, a podcast creator, and a mentor——always building, always shipping. Formerly lead and grew products + teams at Zoho Corp.

Currently leading AI-led initiatives at [Stitchflow](https://www.stitchflow.com), working with models, agents, and orchestration tools to reimagine corporate IT visibility.

**What I work on**

- AI Products: agents, orchestration, LLM-powered workflows, prompt engineering
- Zero-to-one: taking products from idea → prototype → shipped (did this with VaniHQ, Event Tech SDK, and more)
- AR/XR: building immersive experiences like [Bengaluru Hogona AR](https://github.com/aishwaryaashok14/bengaluru-hogona-ar)
- GenAI Filmmaking: creating AI-animated films with Luma AI, Midjourney, Runway, and ElevenLabs — [watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@aishwaryaashok)
- Product strategy: positioning, GTM, competitive analysis, growth loops
- Builder tools: Augment, Codex, Claude Code, Google AI Studio, Cursor

🎬 **[AI Films](https://www.youtube.com/@aishwaryaashok)** — My GenAI filmmaking channel. I create AI-animated short films and visual stories using Luma AI, Midjourney, Runway, and ElevenLabs — pushing the boundaries of what's possible when AI meets storytelling. Featured work includes _**"Glimmers"**_, an AI-animated film blending generative visuals with narrative craft.

🌐 **[aishashok.com](https://aishashok.com)** — My personal space where I write about technology, product management, design, and life philosophy. Includes my product & tech articles, newsletter, art, poetry, and thoughts on building at the intersection of growth mindset, empathy, and ethical tech.

🎨 **[Rue Des Arts](https://shop.aishashok.com)** — My handpainted watercolor art shop. Fine-binding notebooks, art prints, postcards, and travel tags inspired by streets and stories from Madras, Goa, Jaipur, Hampi, and beyond. Every piece is hand-illustrated — because I believe builders should create with their hands too.
