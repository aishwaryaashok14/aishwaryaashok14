# Hey, I'm Aishwarya Ashok

**Product Lead | Forward-Deployed AI PM | Builder**

I'm a product builder with 9+ years in SaaS — currently leading AI-first initiatives at [Stitchflow](https://www.stitchflow.com). I've shipped zero-to-one products, scaled product marketing, and worked across MarTech automation, real-time collaboration platforms, and event technology.

These days, I'm deep into AI agents, orchestration, and turning models into working products.
