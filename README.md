<h1> Hi, I'm Aishwarya 👋 </h1>

I build AI-first products and ship them — from zero-to-one platforms to agent-powered tools that solve real problems.

9+ years in SaaS, now fully focused on AI agents, orchestration, and turning models into products people actually use. I've been a founding PM, a product marketer, a podcast creator, and a mentor — always building, always shipping.

Currently leading AI-led initiatives at [Stitchflow](https://www.stitchflow.com), working with models, agents, and orchestration tools to reimagine corporate IT visibility.

**What I work on**

- AI Products: agents, orchestration, LLM-powered workflows, prompt engineering
- Zero-to-one: taking products from idea → prototype → shipped (did this with VaniHQ, Event Tech SDK, and more)
- AR/XR: building immersive experiences like [Bengaluru Hogona AR](https://github.com/aishwaryaashok14/bengaluru-hogona-ar)
- GenAI + Video: exploring AI-driven filmmaking and video workflows
- Product strategy: positioning, GTM, competitive analysis, growth loops
- Builder tools: Augment, Codex, Claude Code, Google AI Studio, Cursor
